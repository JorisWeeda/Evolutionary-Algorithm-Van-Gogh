# Evolutionary-Algorithm-Van-Gogh
Genetic Algorithms excel at solving many optimization problems. In this project we will be considering a rather unusual optimization problem: imitating art. The optimization problem in this project is to find an approximation of an existing painting, given a (limited) set of primitives
